Halo friend! You are at my first post!! Exciting, huh? After tutorials, debugging, tutorials, debugging, debugging, debugging... in the last two days, THIS SITE IS ACTUALLY RUNNING! Big shout out to [the Gatsby team](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/about/) and the awesome developer community. Yay!! ðŸ™Œ

<span class='inline-text-larger-font'>About this blog. </span> I plan to make posts while I'm self-learning stuff (mostly computer science and programming). The content might be just notes or lists of things I find useful. Kind of a public record of my learning progress, but I wish it'd also be helpful for you in some way.  

<span class='inline-text-larger-font'>What I'm working on right now. </span>I'm
at the beginning of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/), which
is a completely open-source coding curriculum on web development fundamentals.
Besides the curriculum, it comes with [a Discord
community](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/join-the-odin-community)
for learners to ask questions and chat with each other, which is really nice and
cool.

So yeah, I'll definitely elaborate on what I'm getting out of the project later. Hope to see you soon. Cheers! ðŸ¥‚
