Hello friends! I've just spent one week on the [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations) (TOP), completing the *Introduction* and *Installations* sections. In case you haven't read my first blog and heard about the project yet, this is an open-source curriculum on web development. Awesome, let's see what I've been up to this week. 🚀

##### Web Basics
The *Introduction* section covers web basics such as protocols, clients and servers, IP Addresses, DNS Servers, etc. Besides, I've learned a few interesting facts from the materials. Have you ever thought about the difference between ***the Internet*** and ***the Web***? Have you heard of the ***trailing dots of domain names***? Well, no and no for me till I took the project. I tend to use the Internet and the Web interchangeably, but if we want to be more precise, [the Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet) would be used to refer to the infrastructure that connects computers around the globe, while [the Web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web), formally as the World Wide Web, is one of the most commonly used services on the Internet. As for the domain names, I've learned the concept of [fully-qualified DNS domain names](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fully_qualified_domain_name), which means complete and unambiguous domain names, and those names actually have a dot at the end. Nice to know.

##### Dev Environment
Setting up a proper development environment is required by TOP before going on to code. Since Windows—the operating system I use—is not an option for taking the curriculum, I installed ***Ubuntu desktop***. This turns out to be the toughest task for me this week, as I've spent hours just to get my network to function properly. I've rebooted a lot, and also tried reinstallation once, but in the end, it's a USB WiFi Adapter that has saved my life. So there might be some packages or drivers needing to be updated, yet the updating has to be done with a network (paradox huh?). Fortunately, things began to go well after plugging in the "magic" USB and running the upgrade commands on the system. At the moment I've pretty much set up my development environment, with [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/) as the OS, [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as the text editor, and [Git](https://git-scm.com/) as the version control system. Great! 👏

##### Basic Command Lines
The materials have introduced commands such as `cd`, `ls`, `cp`, `mkdir`, `rm`, `mv`, `ln`, `|`, `>`, etc. Most of these commands are familiar to me as I use them occasionally in my work as a data engineer. Still, I've found the ***links (`ln`)*** commands and ***Input/Output (`|`, `>`)*** commands kind of new to me, which I believe can be used to achieve complex functionalities. Though the more advanced command-line knowledge isn't covered in this section, TOP has linked some useful resources to learn more. I've saved [Conquering the Command Line](https://www.softcover.io/read/fc6c09de/unix_commands/frontmatter) by Mark Bates and [Learn Enough Command Line to Be Dangerous](https://www.learnenough.com/command-line-tutorial) (cool name) by Michael Hartl. Both are comprehensive handbooks on command lines.  

##### Some other pieces of stuff

- **An Article - [Learning to Code: When It Gets Dark](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learning-to-code-when-it-gets-dark-e485edfb58fd/#.yjh0fehje) by *Alexander Kallaway*:** This article is linked by TOP for Motivation and Mindset. Although it's like another motivational article, this one resonated so well with me. I think this article is worth coming back to whenever feeling daunted by the coding journey. Alex himself as a self-taught developer has offered a lot of actionable and effective advice.
 > I would think: it would be nice to explore this and that, but I really want to get better at this one thing, so I’d better focus on it once again!
- **A Book - [The 5 Elements of Effective Thinking](https://www.amazon.com/5-Elements-Effective-Thinking/dp/0691156662/) by *Edward B. Burger* and *Michael Starbird*:** This book was recommended in [a podcast episode]((https://devchat.tv/ruby-rogues/131-rr-how-to-learn/)) that discussed how to learn. Up to this point I've only finished reading about the first element of effective thinking- ***Understand Deeply***. But I've already seen some benefits from it on my thinking when faced with difficulties in the workplace. As advised by the authors, when faced with a difficult problem, we should first try to resolve some easier subproblem, and this will bring us to a resolution of the original one. The mindset has helped me to not get trapped by the complexities of a large problem, but rather to puzzle out it by focusing on smaller ones.
- **A TV Series - [The Great](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2235759/) on *Hulu*:** Well, this one is certainly not directly related to learning, but I want to mention it as my recreation for the week. Though the production is a bit too bizarre and absurd (with lots of intimate scenes), the characters by ***Elle Fanning*** and ***Nicholas Hoult*** appear to be fascinating and the costumes and design are just pleasing.

So, a week with not a lot of learning but still many things going on. I'm now gearing up to actually write some codes, on my new OS! 😉
