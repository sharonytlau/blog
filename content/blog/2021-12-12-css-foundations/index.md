Well, it's blog time on Sunday. For some reasons I'm feeling a little overwhelmed and upset this week. üôç So, apologize in advance for maybe not sounding as cheerful as I was in my previous blogs. 

This week is my third week learning the [TOP](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum. I have finished the section [CSS Foundations](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations#css-foundations), in which some fundamental CSS concepts and Chrome DevTools features are covered. Although I've been working with CSS quite a bit in some of my past projects, like [this one](https://github.com/sharonytlau/dash-moodquote), I realized there were many gaps in my knowledge of the subject while I was learning this week. It's quite a lot to digest. Below are some of the concepts in bullet points, including links to useful materials. 

* __[The Font Families](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-family)__: The `font-family` CSS property specifies a list of one or more font family names and/or [generic family names](https://www.w3.org/Style/Examples/007/fonts.en.html) for the selected HTML elements. Choosing the right font can greatly improve a website's user experience. Besides our favorite fonts, there are some widely available [Web Safe Fonts](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_websafe_fonts.asp) that we should consider using. Also, we should always include a generic font family as a fallback. When listing the font family names, remember to quote the font name if it's more than one word, like: "Times New Roman", but do not quote generic family names since they are keywords. 


* __[The Cascade of CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Cascade)__: The cascade is an algorithm that defines how to combine property values originating from different sources. When there are conflicts in values declared for some styling properties, the cascade is there to resolve them. [This blog post](https://wattenberger.com/blog/css-cascade) has clearly outlined the rules with visualization of the cascade. Understanding them will help avoid the tendency to write `!important` everywhere in the style sheet while keeping the styling right in complex projects.

* __[The Box Model](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/The_box_model)__: Everything on a webpage is a rectangular box. There are two types of boxes: `block` and `inline`, and every HTML element has a default `display` value among the two. [This tutorial](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/css-display-inline-vs-inline-block) briefly explains the different display values. We can use them to change how elements behave in the [normal flow](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Normal_Flow). Besides, there is a `box-sizing` property. Setting the property to `border-box` is called using the [alternative box model](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/The_box_model#the_alternative_css_box_model). This is a common choice among developers as it makes setting width and height more intuitive (see [this article](https://css-tricks.com/box-sizing/) on CSS Tricks).

* __[Chrome DevTools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/)__: Chrome DevTools is a set of web developer tools built directly into the Google Chrome browser that helps to edit pages on the fly and diagnose problems quickly.
    They can be used to view and change the [DOM](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/dom/) as well as the [CSS](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/css/). We can easily edit element [attributes](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/dom/#attributes), toggle CSS [pseudostates](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/css/#pseudostates) and [classes](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/css/#classes), inspect CSS [Grid](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/css/grid/), and so on. Knowing the tools and their [keyboard shortcuts](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/shortcuts/#elements) will boot efficiency in front-end development.

    There are some other important concepts, such as [links styles](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_link.asp), [CSS selectors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Selectors), and [margin collapsing](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/m/margin/#collapsing-margins), that I've learned this week. I guess I will write about them when I work on projects and put them into practice. Cheers. ü•Ç
